# Serendipity Design Guide 

The aim of this guide is to explain, in two parts, why this repository exists.
In doing so, I hope to lay the foundation for others to build on and to use in
understanding my reasoning when discussing contributions or designs. The first
part of that explanation is to discuss the essential ideals and reasons that
have led me down the laborious path of designing and implementing a programming
language and IDE stack from top-to-bottom in my free time. The second is to
elaborate on the specific design and implementation decisions I have made in
actualizing my vision for the components of Serendipity and why.

## Background

At the time of writing, I've been a professional software engineer for a short
three months. Before that, I was a PhD student at the University of Colorado
Boulder where I worked on learning-focused programming environments for
children (middle-school aged). I was a member of the
[Laboratory for Playful Computation][lpc]. I have a lot of interest in what
kinds of programming language features could have a positive impact on students'
learning. Keep this in mind, as the design of Serendipity is essentially a
collection of my hypotheses relating to that question.
